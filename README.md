# ForestFirePrediction
The forest fire is predicted based on the Temperature and Humidity.
This dataset is prepared using the previously occured forest fires in the world.. Collected the temperature and humidty of such places during forest fires.
In the front-end part I have used GoogleMap API from Google Cloud Platform to gram the Latitude and Longitude of particular places.
I have used 'OpenWeatherMap' API to grab the temperature and humidity of different locations.

Also the machine learning model has been trained using Logistic Regression Classifier with 91% accuracy.
And the model has been connected to the website using the Python Flask Framework.
